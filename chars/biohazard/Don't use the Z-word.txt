************************* Move List ************************************

   but both of them will puke on you every now and then)
	1. Can be summoned up to a total of 6 on screen.
	2. Can be summoned anytime except when Tyrant appears in Round 2.

	2. Can be summoned from beginning of 2nd Round after 1st is lost.

A Button = FLAMING ZOMBIE (up to 2 on screen)
  (Does more damage than a Normal Zombie due to the flames. They also
   like to puke on you sometimes as well)
	1. Health gauge must be below 50% during 1st Round.
	2. Can be summoned from beginning of 2nd Round after 1st is lost.

B Button = CERBERUS (up to 1 on screen)

After the 1st round is lost, and life is under 40% during the 2nd round,

********************(^o^)/Advice while playing(^o^)/********************

(1)If you watch many zombie movies, you should know that
standing with your back against the the wall, means you 
are about to get eaten alive. Try to stay in the middle of
the screen and prepare for enemies coming from both sides.

(2)Even if you get grabbed while surrounded by multiple enemies,
stay calm, and jump away from them to keep a safe distance.
If you stay in the same position, you will keep getting bitten
over and over again until you end up as their meal.

(3)A zombie laying flat on his face after being either sweeped, or knocked down
by another zombie that you pushed into them, can be hit with another sweep
while they are on the ground, but you will regret it if you get too close. 

(4)Cerberus is so fast and annoying with their unblockable jump attack, but it
will not hit you while you are crouching. But don't get too comfortable crouching,
because the other enemies will grab you regardless.

(5)Tyrant has an invisible anger gauge, that will slowly charge up when you keep
attacking him consecutively, until you hit him while he is pissed off to the max,
and he will knock you away with a roar of rage. However, he will also drop a herb 
which will give you some life if you can grab it.


******************(>_<)-------Known Problems-------(T_T)*********************************

(1)If fought against a CPU opponent, the CPU will start attacking some
invisible enemy and will not be any fun to watch, so I suggest placing this
character as a CPU-Only character in your select.def.

(2)Since pressing back on the D-pad will make your character turn around,
this some times makes QCB or HCB moves difficult. Try to input such
commands quickly, or by canceling normal attacks. There is also a split
second delay before actually turning around after pressing back on the
D-pad (which is what enables you to enter backwards commands at all),
so be extra careful of those enemies that are sneaking up from behind you.
(You can charge for Sonic Boom type moves, by pressing diagonal-back while crouching)

(3)Some characters will automatically be forced to turn around after landing
from a backwards jump. Occasionally there are even some characters that will
not turn around at all, which you will just have to accept the fact that the
 particular character is not compatible.

(4)Due to limitations of MUGEN, helpers can not be thrown...Thus, throw techniques
will not work.(Since most Ranbu Attacks are treated like throws, most Ranbu Attacks
will not work either...I know, that sucks)


		-------Might Add-------
Player's "turn" process can use improvement.
