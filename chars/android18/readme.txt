Version 1.0
Released 12-11-07

This is my little present to the ladies.

Android 18 in Choujin style.

Intro/Ending made in 2013 by Tomo

YES IT IS Big Eli's 18.

But after picking up a controllor for 5 seconds you'll realize that its just the her looks and effects.

I changed her gameplay.

She was a 6 button character. I had to change her to a 4 button + charge and zanouken character.
Don't worry all of the moves are still there, they are re routed to other areas.
She had no dashing moves..I added those
I changed her counter system to that choujin style.
I swapped out all of the dust effects.
The combo system has been tweaked and redone. The loss of the C kick and Z punch left holes in the old system. I've added things to make it solid and more deadly than it ever was before.
The damage is increased on her moves to rival that of my other characters.
She is resized to be bigger(consequently i had to change the offset of all of her effects to fit the new body)
Certain Hypers have been move to level 3 and level to.
She still will have more hypers than everybody else. But only 2 are level 1 now as opposed to 4...so lots of charging will be required to get to the higher more deadly level 2 hypers.
She is equipped with powerful AI. Expect her to be the most deadly(yet beautiful) thing walking. She's got prettier combos than any other character.



AND PLEASE DON'T COMPLAIN ABOUT ME RUINING SOMETHING YOU LIKED ABOUT ELI'S 18...........IF YOU WANT THAT STUFF.......YOU CAN ALWAYS GET THE ORIGINAL FROM rANDOMSELECT!

sorry but i have to put that disclaimer because I had people saying stuff months ago just because I announced that I would be doing 18.
