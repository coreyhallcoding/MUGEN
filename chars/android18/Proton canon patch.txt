Proton Canon Patch for Android 18
Made by smhungary89
Released 28-02-19

Description: Stig87's Android 18 is one of the best known version of this character.
It have a secret move called "l33t" which was originally designed as a suicide, joke move.
She summons Iron Man's famous proton canon, charge it, but when she tries to fire it, it fails and explodes.
Killing both her, and her enemy too, if it gets too close.
The AI never use this move by default, only the player can use it.

I basically modified this move, and make it as an actual hyper move, available not just for the player, but the AI too. Enjoy! :)

Installation: It's easy, just extract it, and overwrite everything.
