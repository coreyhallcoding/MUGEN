This is an unfinished beta. She will never be finished. Do whatever the fuck you want with
this character, I don't care.

Do not e-mail me about this character or about ANYTHING MUGEN related. This is not a comeback.
This is a "I'm-doing-this-so-you'll-leave-me-the-fuck-alone" release. Fuck the MUGEN community.

I am not doing the same thing with Silent Storm and Jill. Don't even ask.

If you want to fix it/finish it/use coding from it/change the authorname and say it's yours, I don't fucking care.

If you think this character sucks, you're not obligated to keep it. I didn't do this for you.

These characters are released on the condition that I no longer be bother by leechers. If this condition is broken, they will be removed and you're back to bitching about it on request forums.

I fixed the SFF, So it will work with DOS and WinMUGEN. Don't bother thanking me.

select.cfg and add the line:"18, stages/_______.def" 

What's new?________________________________________________________________
What do you think?

Gameplay Overview__________________________________________________________


Use special moves and combos to build your meter. Energy attacks are free to use. Charging not in play. Guard Cancels in play. Roman Cancels in play. Flight Resrictions: You can fly at will, but you can only spend a limited time in the air before being forced to land. Once you land from flying, you cannot fly again until you hear a chime and see the words "FLIGHT OK".

Brief definition of game systems:

Charging: You can use this to build up your power meter manually. 

Hyper Battle: If you get tech hitted during a throw attempt, you and your opponent will engage in a high-speed battle. During this time, both players must press buttons as fast as possible. Whoever has the most button presses during the battle time will have the opponent at their mercy. 

Guard Cancels: If you have 1 1/2 levels of power, you can cancel a guard into certain specials.

Roman Cancels: Just like in GGX, use it to interrupt any move, including specials.

Fighting tips_______________________________________________________________
18's air fireballs can hit grounded opponents. Quite a handy technique, especially when you've put the opponent on their back. ;)

You can tell who's winning the Hyper Battle by the direction the fight is going. If you're being pushed backwards, it's not a good sign.

On that note, 18 is in a more compromising position if she loses a Hyper Battle, so TAP THOSE BUTTONS!

The Aerial Power Blitz fires slightly faster than the Ground power blitz, but has a longer lag time afterward.

Roman cancels are great for making some insane combos.... just be sure to only use them when you can't cancel a move any other way.

Known Issues____________________________________________________
Hyper Battle may not look correct with everyone. It will still work.

Plans for next version____________________________________________________
Fuck you.
