Out of boredom one day I figured I redownload MUGEN, my Broli, and update him. This does not mean I will be returning to 
actively create characters for MUGEN; I just don't enjoy 2D fighting games as much I as I used to.

I have intentionally left out my contact info for privacy. Any questions or comments regarding myself, this character, or 
any of my MUGEN works can be directed to "Kung Fu Man" at: http://randomselect.i-xcell.com

Overview:
--------------
Broli is known as "The Legendary Super Saiya-jin", and is by far, the most powerful Saiya-jin in the 
series. It is because of his tremendous power that he and his father survived the destruction of the planet Vegeta.

This character was not made under the influence of any one particular style in mind, but rather, made from the ideas of
various 2D fighting games I've played, with some original elements. The sprites are based on Bandai's "Super Boutuden 2"
for the SuperFamicon, then heavily modified/recoloured by Dreamweaver. Additional sprite edits were then provided by Roken.

Notes/Issues: 
-----------
(Updated 08/12/06)

	-Changed armor-hit behaviour; opponent will no longer completely stop when hitting Broli, but pause for a brief period.

(Updated 08/09/06)
	-Changed Broli's big portrait; courtesy of Intense_MC.
	-Changed AI activation to Winane's method; http://www.mugenguild.net/~winane

	 the character is already able to cancel the move normally with a Zanzouken.
	-Changed armor-hit behaviour.
	-Fixed an issue where the AI was able to cancel "Satsubatsu Yakushin" into itself even though the player cannot.

	-"Moushin Rariatto" and "Satsubatsu Geri" now compliment each other; each move has a different guarding restriction.
